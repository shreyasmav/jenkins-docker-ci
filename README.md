# Jenkins Project

## Overview

Jenkins Project



- Create a CI/CD pipeline, so that whenever the code in commit in Github it will initiate CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins once it completes successfully then Jenkins will create a Docker image and will push Docker image to Dockerhub.

NOTE: I want you to use simple python application. In Jenkinsfile, please have 3 stages called ‘Your Name - Build Docker Image’, ‘Your Name - Login to Dockerhub’ and ‘Your Name - Push image to Dockerhub’.


- Please explain your project and record yourself.

- You need to have Dockerhub account.

- Record shouldn`t exceed 5 minutes.

- Your python application name should be yourname.py
